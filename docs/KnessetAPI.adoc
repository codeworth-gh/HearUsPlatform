= Knesset API

== Filters
OData has filters based on XML content. It's added like this: `http://server/endpoint-url?$filter=Field op param`.

[NOTE]
The `field op param` part has to be URL-encoded. So add `%20` for spaces: `field%20op%20param`.

All factions of the 20th Knesset::
    `curl 'http://knesset.gov.il/Odata/ParliamentInfo.svc/KNS_Faction()?$filter=KnessetNum%20eq%2020'`

Current People in the Knesset::
    `http://knesset.gov.il/Odata/ParliamentInfo.svc/KNS_Person?$filter=IsCurrent`

[WARNING]
This includes MKs **AND** other people too. Filter on `PersonToPosition` to know what that person is doing there.
